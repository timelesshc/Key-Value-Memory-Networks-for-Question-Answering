# Key-Value-Memory-Networks-for-Question-Answering
-	Developed a data preprocessing pipeline to filter and prepare a dataset of over 728k Wikipedia biographies in the format of title and infobox, and utilized GloVe for word embeddings.
-	Implemented a key-value memory network model with an attention-scoring mechanism and trained it on 40k data using PyTorch on the Cloud GPU (A100) via Google Colab platform.
-	Achieved 92% accuracy during training and 70% accuracy in retrieving correct answers during testing, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.
